This is my JavaScript evaluation project.

The page has a basic structure of HTML, JavaScript with some styles with CSS.
It is a series search engine that is obtained through an API, provided by Adalab. It is made up of a text form where the user enters the title of the series to search for. Once the button is clicked, a list of series appears.
Using localStorage, and clicking on the series card, the user can obtain a list of favorite series.

A basic HTML structure has been used within the index, ending the structure in the JS file.

I hope it is useful to you.

All the best!!
